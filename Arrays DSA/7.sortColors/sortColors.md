**Description:**
Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, where each object is color coded as integer: blue, 0 for red, 1 for white, and 2 for blue. We need to sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are grouped together, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

This problem needs to be solved without using the library's sort function.

### Examples

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,0,1,2,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,0]
Output: [0,1,2]
